my answers to Project Euler https://projecteuler.net/

Goal
----

My goal is to solve the problems in as many languages as possible.  Most
of my initial progress has been in python since that's the language I'm
most actively learning.  [problem 2](problem002) has a bash implementation.
But expect more bizarre languages soon like lua, JavaScript, PostScript and Scala.
