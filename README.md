====================

my answers to Project Euler https://projecteuler.net/

Goal
----

My goal is to solve the problems in as many languages as possible.  Most
of my initial progress has been in python since that's the language I'm
most actively learning.  [problem 2](problem002) has a bash implementation.
But expect more bizarre languages soon like lua, JavaScript, PostScript and Scala.

Note
----

The answer implementations may output various progress indications.
The answer that [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) wants
is indicated by a line that starts with `ANSWER:`.  We can't verify
the correctness automatically because of the captcha.  My answers
are correct according to Project Euler except where indicated in the
git history.
