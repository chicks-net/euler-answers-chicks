# Euler Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

[Problem definition](http://projecteuler.net/problem=12):
>    The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7^th triangle number would be
>    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
>
>                                         1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
>
>    Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
>
>       1: 1
>       3: 1,3
>       6: 1,2,3,6
>      10: 1,2,5,10
>      15: 1,3,5,15
>      21: 1,3,7,21
>      28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
>
>    We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
>
>    What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?


Performance Analysis
--------------------

The naive Python implementation takes almost 8 hours:

	real	476m43.205s
	user	476m47.021s
	sys	0m3.277s

My first attempt at optimization took __x__ hours:

I've been trying to do this by hand and do it in python, but I'm considering using a library for the factorization to "cheat".
It looks like [Msieve](http://sourceforge.net/p/msieve/wiki/Home/) is a C library that does this fast and
[PySieve](https://github.com/dansefatale/PySieve) is a python wrapper for it.  But I haven't tried it yet.

The quick Perl implementation takes a few seconds:

	real	0m7.386s
	user	0m3.342s
	sys	0m0.030s
